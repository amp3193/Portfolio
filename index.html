                                <p class="card-text">Gonna Rewrite all of this. I have a Bachelor's degree in Communications from Florida State. I
                                    wanted to write and create but
                                    also craved a fast-paced work environement. After writing for the FSView newspaper
                                    and interning
                                    at a PR firm I decided to use my skills in Public Relations. Life happened and I
                                    took a haitus
                                    from working to raise a family. After that time the public relations game had
                                    changed because of
                                    social media and it was obvious I would have to relearn the field. Inspired by my
                                    husband who is
                                    a Software Developer I decided to learn software instead.
                                    I taught myself QA. I took online courses on software testing and took the ISTQB to
                                    be certified
                                    in software testing. I worked for almost 4 years testing software as a Quality
                                    Assurance
                                    Engineer. I found some interesting bugs and really enjoyed mobile and API testing.
                                    However, I
                                    found myself interested more than just testing.</p>
